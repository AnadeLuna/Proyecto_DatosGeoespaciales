----------------------------

IÂ´m doing the bootcamp of Data Analytics in Ironchak. And this is my third proyect.

The objetive of this proyect is to demonstrate all i learned with Mongo queries, api queries and GeoVisualization. 

This project is focused on looking for the new place office for a company. Some of the requirements are:

- 30% of the company staff have at least 1 child.
- Developers like to be near successful tech startups that have raised at least 1 Million dollars.
- Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not too far.
- Account managers need to travel a lot.
- Everyone in the company is between 25 and 40, give them some place to go party.

And for this proyect I used a database in my Mongodb "Companies" and queries to Foursquare api.

In folder "src" you can find all queries with a visualization maps.
